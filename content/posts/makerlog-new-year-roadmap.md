As 2019 approaches rapidly, I've began my yearly journey of introspection and quiet reflection about what Makerlog is and what direction to take it. 

It's incredible to look back and see the great growth of our community in such a short span of time - we're approaching 1000 friends - in just around six months! This is my first succesful software project, and I plan to continue growing it throughout this new year and beyond. 

So let's discuss direction now! Below are a few topics that will be important in the following months for the growth and continuity of our community.

### Financials
This is the elephant in the room, so it only makes sense to get it out of the way first. Many questions and concerns have been raised over the longevity of this project. 

#### "Uh, @matteing, how are we doing?"

Makerlog is cash flow positive due to the generous donations from the community, and at the current rate of growth, funded for the next 2 years.

We're doing ~~fine~~ great. #hatersgonnahate

#### "Okay, but free isn't sustainable."

Donations have proven effective for Makerlog, but I won't ignore it - Makerlog needs another revenue source to assure true longevity. 

Since the beginning, I've said the same thing...

> once we reach 1000 users, I'll consider adding a premium plan

The time has come to consider it. Makerlog is rapidly approaching 1000 users.

#### Foundations for a Makerlog Premium plan

Makerlog will be monetized in an ethical manner, keeping inclusiveness in mind. After all, Makerlog was founded on the core principle of fostering inclusive communities rather than exclusive ones.

**I promise to make sure the following happens:**

1. The plan will be priced affordably.
2. Makerlog will remain free. Of course.
3. The plan will only contain value added features (say a dark mode or other cool things). 

#### Concluding financials

All in all, we're doing great. And I will make sure to keep it that way.


### Development

Time to touch the development part! 

#### API

A public API is already completed - it's lacking in documentation. This year, I commit to writing easy to understand API documentation and a series of tutorials on how to do cool things - like creating apps for Makerlog!

#### Mobile

The current state of mobile on Makerlog is atrocious, and this will be a focus for the upcoming year.

There will be no promises here - but I'm looking to create a mobile app and a responsive web browsing experience.
