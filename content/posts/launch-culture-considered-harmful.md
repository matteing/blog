These are my notes on a series of what I consider harmful misconceptions in the maker community. <!--more-->

## Preface

I will kick this off by explaining a couple of things, in the interest of full transparency, just as I did on my thread:

1.  This is not meant to raise pitchforks. Put them down.
2.  If you're building side projects for fun rather than trying to build a business, this doesn't really apply to you.
3.  This has nothing to do with Makerlog: this is my opinion rather than my product's.

Alright, now that we've got these things out of the way, let's go.

## A bit of context

On September 18, one of the makers in our community (or one of the makers in Ramadan Makers) launched a product on a popular product discovery site, gathering a decent amount of upvotes from the community. However, we noticed it never really made the homepage even after decent community attention. In contrast, we noticed other products with fewer upvotes managed a feature, even though user engagement was little.

We proceeded to discuss this heavily on a Ramadan Makers video call with several members of the community, and arrived to the conclusion that a possible algorithm change caused the product to never reach the homepage. To be fully honest here, this is fine: we don't expect makers to get featured all the time.

However, we began thinking about the incident as an indication of a bigger problem in the maker community. We've created a harmful culture for ourselves: the launch-and-dump culture.

I will examine my ideas on the subject throughout a list of points. These are mostly notes, not particularly structured too well.

## #1: Launching on _x-aggregator_ shouldn't make or break your product.

Lately I've noticed a trend I consider very harmful: glorifying aggregator launches as the end-all-be-all of product marketing.

This should come as no surprise, but they aren't. Your product's success does not depend on a successful launch on x place. You'll gain a lot of initial traction, but depending on the niche the aggregator targets, this traction may just simply vanish overnight.

### Why you should launch on aggregators

1.  Initial traction and press. The press especially will help you reach a much broader audience rather than just the aggregator.
2.  The aggregator is specific to your niche.
3.  Feedback on landing copy, technical aspect, and bug hunting. It's so helpful in this case and seriously helps refine your product.

### Why you shouldn't launch on aggregators

1.  Validation, unless the aggregator is specific to your niche. _(will be covered in point #2)_
2.  Internet points and clout. _(let's get real, sadly a lot of people do this)_
3.  To use that launch as your main marketing strategy

### On aggregators as a central marketing strategy

The reason many use aggregator launches as a centerpiece of their marketing strategy is due to countless success stories out there spread by many founders. I admit I've taken part of this group of people.

This is a very reductive view of why x-product is successful.

1.  Product X is probably successful due to a lot of work behind the scenes.
2.  Product X is probably successful due to much more marketing than the surface shows.

Aggregator launches should not be a central part of your marketing strategy. Instead, build a proper marketing strategy with multiple fallbacks and distribution channels.

Now, I'm not saying aggregator launches aren't a great way of getting eyeballs on your product. I'm saying making them **the only way** is a really bad thing.

[Jon Yongfook recently wrote a thread that really inspired me to think about distribution channel ownership.](https://twitter.com/yongfook/status/1174565500803633153) The gist: own your distribution channels, build your audience, and reduce your reliance on marketing in external sites (subject to algorithm changes).

This includes newsletters, personal websites with updates, blogs, and much more. I'm glad to say many makers are really dominating the blogging and content creation space, which is a great step towards reducing reliance on Twitter and other sites for traction. Makers like Anne-Laure, with her recently launched and very successful blog, come to mind.

### Conclusion

An algorithm on any aggregator shouldn't make or break your product. We should reduce reliance on these entities, and diversify our marketing strategies (almost like an investment portfolio). We must begin owning our distribution channels.

Giving sole entities so much power over our product's success is concerning, and quite honestly just indicates a bigger problem in our culture. This is _not_ fine.

## #2: Hype is not validation.

This is an ongoing problem in the maker community, a false notion that many makers develop when their products gather significant traction/attention within the community.

It usually goes something like this:

1.  Maker soft-launches on social media or maker communities.
2.  Hype happens.
3.  Maker builds something nobody wants, mistaking the hype for validation.

In part, this has been caused by the "launch quick, validate quick" advice being pushed by prominent makers out there. Sadly, in the community's case, many launch quick and validate in the wrong places.

In the entrepreneurial community, there's a well-known piece of advice that usually guides our search for validation in the beginning: never validate with friends or family. I find Josh Kaufman puts it best in his book, and it's been my source of truth regarding feedback/validation for a while:

> Your inner circle typically wants you to succeed and wants to maintain a good relationship with you, so it’s likely that they’ll unintentionally sugarcoat their feedback. For best results, be sure to get plenty of feedback from people who aren’t personally invested in you or your project.
>
> Kaufman, Josh. “The Personal MBA.”

The maker community has the image of being relatively objective. We are, in some aspects, especially the technical part. We're also great at giving feedback, and support each other like a family.

Ah, see what I did there? Sadly, the last part of that sentence is exactly why you shouldn't validate within the community, even if you are targeting the maker/developer niche. Similar to a family, we're very invested in each other and want to encourage our projects, even if they're not particularly great.

### Your mini-guide to launching in a community:

Change your mindset. You should not launch for validation within your own community. Seek **feedback** and **traction** instead. Use the feedback to better your product, find kinks and bugs you didn't notice while building. Use the traction to seek what I like to call **golden nuggets** (which I'll explain in a bit).

### Case study: the Cowork.to launch

The Cowork.to launch was experiment to put this mindset to the test. We set very clear expectations before the announcement, telling ourselves we wouldn't let it go to our heads if there was hype.

However, something very unexpected happened: certain market segments we implicitly targeted reached out to us with great interest, validating some use cases we had outlined in our business model canvas. **This is what I eventually came to call a _golden nugget_: unexpected validation from a market segment during a moment of traction.**

This proved far more valuable than any other feedback received during the launch. This was something unexpected, that proved our theory.

### Conclusion

All in all, don't mistake hype for validation. Seek feedback and initial traction from the community, but don't confuse positive reinforcement with idea validation. Seek gold nuggets from your initial launch in any aggregators or social media sites.

Do customer discovery interviews and have a clear target audience set when launching on these sites.

The ultimate validation, however, is simply when people get their wallets and go through your Stripe checkout.

## #3: Product lifecycles shouldn't be so short.

Finally, I take issue with product lifecycles in the maker community. This has been discussed to death on my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/matteing/status/1145479277065986051) and on Telegram group chats, so I'll just stick to saying a few words about it.

### "Ship that shit, but don't ship shit."

This is a phrase I use quite often to allude to products that are shipped fast with the intent of a hyped launch and clout building. This is the complete opposite of what I believe in when shipping products.

Have a quality bar and stick to it.

### Believe in your product. Try your best.

I see many products that get a launch and die off. This is what I call launch-and-dump culture, and I deeply disagree with it.

Launch a product and continue building it. Success takes time. Market it, pivot, change your ideas, gather feedback. At least _try_. This is in stark contrast to what others push in the community about "fail fast" culture, but I feel throwing things against the wall to see what sticks is a fundamentally flawed idea.

I'm not against trying many ideas. I have countless failed projects. I'm against _not even trying_. Products take effort and passion to build, and you're doomed if your mindset is one of cancelling at the slightest sign of difficulty.

Nobody will make your product successful. No external force or launch will either.

Success solely depends on you. Be your idea's greatest fan.

## Conclusion and a call for community action

I honestly think this is an education problem. We've pushed and glorified the wrong ideas, and only the community can self-correct its course.

Ultimately these ideas, misconceptions, don't help makers become more successful. They are detrimental to our core philosophy of building sustainable businesses, and we must stop spreading them.

These are just my opinions as a passionate member of the community.

As always, I hope you learn something. 💚
