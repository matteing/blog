<p>It was a dark, foggy night. In a cozy bed, I laid fast asleep after a long day of university lectures and late-night coding.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a long, annoying noise shook me off my sleep. Crawling to the other side of my bed, I reach my desk and clumsily grab my phone, in an attempt to <em>shut that shit down</em>.</p>

<p>It was a call. A call from a <a href="https://getmakerlog.com">Makerlog</a> member.</p>

<p>When I saw that caller ID, I instantly knew <em>something was going down</em>. And it was not good.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Nt4vukp.png" alt="uh oh" /></p>

<p>It was the beginning of a 2 hour journey into the world of distributed denial-of-service attacks.</p>

<h3 id="the-doctor-arrives-half-asleep">The doctor arrives, half-asleep</h3>

<p>From the call alone and the number of people attempting to reach me on various social media, it was easy to provide an initial diagnosis. I knew exactly what happened to the patient: a simple spammer attack with a sprinkle of server crashing.</p>

<p>It was easy to arrive to this initial conclusion. Makerlog&rsquo;s API is very open and it was easy for people to &ndash; accidentally or purposefully &ndash; spam the server with tasks while fooling around.</p>

<p>These attacks would be promptly (and easily) shut down. It was a matter of entering the admin panel, revoking a few tokens, and banning the IP. One of these attacks had happened the day before - no biggie.</p>

<p>Still in bed, I decided to enter the admin panel, sprinkle some ban hammer goodness, and go back to sleep.</p>

<p>Then came the first surprise.</p>

<h3 id="wth-moment-1">WTH moment #1</h3>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t load the admin panel. Nothing was loading. Not even the simple <code>/health</code> endpoint. This was extremely strange, as Gunicorn + Uvicorn is a super stable combination and even previous spam attacks never really broke the site.</p>

<p>I was essentially mitigating while blind on my phone, as I had no access to the backend API panel.</p>

<p>I asked the community if there were any spam tasks before the site went down, and to my surprise, there were none. Nobody had spammed anything.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sfkKfoH.png" alt="fu" /></p>

<p>This was different.</p>

<p>I began lifting the covers and turning on the lights (and coincidentally waking up my poor, poor fish).</p>

<h3 id="a-reboot-will-do">A reboot will do</h3>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t suspect much yet, and I thought that perhaps the server bugged out. Maybe it was a memory leak.</p>

<p>I was waking up a little more, so I sat down on my bed and opened up JuiceSSH on my phone to try and make sense of the situation.</p>

<p>Makerlog runs on <a href="http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/">Dokku</a>, so my first reaction was to reboot the affected app containers. The infrastructure is very neatly managed by Dokku&rsquo;s abstraction over Docker, so it was easy to prompt a clean reboot (ignore the errors, I was asleep!):</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9o0IifU.png" alt="errors and all" /></p>

<p>After a while, the containers rebooted. I was finally able to access the admin panel, and the attack was mitigated.</p>

<p>&hellip;sike.</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t work, and the problems continued. I proceeded to reboot the whole server, which didn&rsquo;t work either.</p>

<p>I opened the error logs to try and find any issues inside the containers. It was only showing a repeated stream of async/await coroutine errors, so I believed that was the problem.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hWa8ISp.png" alt="async" /></p>

<p>I restarted the containers several more times to get rid of my diagnosed process deadlock, to no avail.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fmR1kKM.png" alt="u" /></p>

<p>As Captain Sully said in his NTSB hearing&hellip; <strong>It was time to get serious.</strong></p>

<h3 id="errors-errors-and-a-sprinkle-of-eureka">Errors, errors, and a sprinkle of eureka</h3>

<p>Getting out of bed, I opened my laptop, hopped on SSH, and tried to figure out the problem.</p>

<p>I looked at the server log in disbelief. I had no idea what was going on.</p>

<p>After taking a look at the errors a few times, I concluded on <em>server error</em>. Makerlog runs on Uvicorn, which uses ASGI, so it is prone to bugs related to async/await. The error was about some coroutine thing, so I went down that path.</p>

<p>I began looking over the async code on the site, trying to find any errors. I surgically examined the WebSockets and database query code to no avail.</p>

<p>Then suddenly&hellip; I was reminded of a possibility I had completely forgotten.</p>

<p><strong>What if someone was pulling off a good ol&rsquo; DDOS?</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SyxX3m9.png" alt="oh shoot" /></p>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be a new thing. I&rsquo;ve previously mitigated attacks related to people spamming the tasks endpoint. Makerlog, although it&rsquo;s around 2.3k members, is still a relatively small and lowkey service. I don&rsquo;t draw too much trouble.</p>

<h3 id="it-was-a-ddos">It was a DDoS</h3>

<p>I was wrong. After taking a look at the Nginx logs, the situation was clear. A user was attacking our site and repeatedly pinging the <code>/products/</code> endpoint.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lEsbwgP.jpg" alt="nginx log" /></p>

<p>The exploit was simple - due to legacy reasons, Makerlog&rsquo;s <code>/products/</code> API endpoint never really used pagination. Since launch, I never expected Makerlog to grow to its current size, so I never really bothered to add pagination.</p>

<p>Therefore, when requesting the endpoint, a massive SQL request would be made, freezing the server while the items were fetched + serialized into JSON (a Django REST Framework performance weak point).</p>

<p>It was perfect. Using this method, they could essentially max out the CPU and crash the entire server (which hosts other in-development apps too).</p>

<p>I focused on adding features and shiny new things rather than fixing fundamental parts of the service. Which is fine&hellip; Until they bite you back in the ass.</p>

<p>And today they did.</p>

<h3 id="mitigation-attempt-1-the-ban-hammer">Mitigation attempt #1: the ban hammer</h3>

<p>So as any panicking citizen does when they receive a DDoS on their production server, I picked up the mighty ol&rsquo; ban hammer, wielding its lightweight yet strong titanium alloy build and utilizing it to kick some ass.</p>

<p>I used Ol&rsquo; Reliable and banned the offending IP addresses.</p>

<p><center>
    <div style="width: 50%">
    <img src="https://i.imgflip.com/2xmca3.jpg" />
    </div>
</center></p>

<h4 id="verdict-didn-t-work">Verdict: didn&rsquo;t work</h4>

<p>Wait a moment&hellip; That didn&rsquo;t work. I would still see requests from a couple of IPs I banned, even after checking UFW several times. The attack kept coming in. The nightmare didn&rsquo;t end.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6mnXdw5.png" alt="of" /></p>

<h3 id="mitigation-attempt-2-pushing-hotfixes">Mitigation attempt #2: pushing hotfixes</h3>

<p>After a bit more thinking, I figured that the best solution at this time was to stop the vulnerability in its tracks. Pushing a new API version with pagination enabled would essentially stop the endpoint from consuming so much CPU and defuse the attack, at the expense of a few broken API apps and the website products page not working.</p>

<p>So knowing it was an easy fix, I quickly patched up the Makerlog <code>/products/</code> endpoint, pushed to Dokku, and patiently waited for the deploy to finish.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wksJKdJ.jpg" alt="source" /></p>

<h4 id="verdict-it-worked">Verdict: it worked!</h4>

<p>After this small change, the server&rsquo;s load reduced significantly and the site was momentarily back up.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OxHe4r0.jpg" alt="stats" /></p>

<p>This victory would be short-lived, however.</p>

<h3 id="mitigation-attempt-3-moving-to-cloudflare">Mitigation attempt #3: Moving to CloudFlare</h3>

<p>Simultaneously, I decided to try and move to CloudFlare after several recommendations from the community. The transition was quick and I was able to set the API to &ldquo;Under Attack&rdquo; mode to require challenge verification to suspicious addresses.</p>

<h4 id="verdict-it-worked-1">Verdict: it worked!</h4>

<p>CloudFlare is a hard one to judge empirically, but from what I see in my analytics post-attack, I can say it definitely helped mitigate the attack and ease load on the server. Huge props to CloudFlare - your free plan is great!</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rD7vKsC.png" alt="cloudflare blocks" /></p>

<h3 id="mitigated-we-re-safe-right">Mitigated! We&rsquo;re safe! Right?</h3>

<p>So the attack is now mitigated, things are fine&hellip; right?</p>

<p>No. After a while, I noticed something very interesting while watching the Nginx logs&hellip; They were getting nervous. They began crawling ALL API endpoints, looking for exploitable ones&hellip;</p>

<p>And they found one. The discussions endpoint suffered the same problem, but mitigating it (now that the cause was known) was easy. I pushed a hotfix and essentially the attack stopped.</p>

<h3 id="relief">Relief</h3>

<p>The attacker gave up, and I could finally breathe.</p>

<p>In total, the attack lasted around 2 hours, from 3 AM to 5 AM my time.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-this-happen">Why did this happen?</h2>

<p>This whole problem was caused by my inexperience, really.</p>

<p>Makerlog, since the start, has been very open. The API has always welcomed all developers to build upon it, which has been a double-edged sword - in one hand, it created a passionate community of developers making awesome tools for Makerlog. In the other, it allowed for attacks like this to happen.</p>

<p>Makerlog, due to its nature of openness, relies heavily on trust upon its users and heavy moderation. I trust my users completely. It was not the first time someone actively exploited the API to cause harm, but it was the first real serious attempt at lasting damage.</p>

<p><strong>The trust factor wasn&rsquo;t the only cause. I was reluctant to fix these pagination issues because I prioritized direction and vision over improving the status quo.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I was wrong.</strong></p>

<p>With growth also come the assholes, and it&rsquo;s time to take another approach.</p>

<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s time for a new approach. Today, I took a few steps to mitigate these attacks in the future.</p>

        <h5>Things I will NOT do:</h5>

            <li>Lock down the API excessively - our dev community is very valuable!</li>
            <li>Handle these attacks lightly.</li>
            <li>Let the terrorists win!</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about a few of these items in detail.</p>

<h5 id="prioritizing-bug-fixes">Prioritizing bug fixes</h5>

<p>Makerlog has been on a roll recently. I recently rolled out (ha) the Wellness update and we&rsquo;re literally in peak Makerlog.</p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;ve taken an approach that I regret. I prioritized vision over fixing the status quo, and this has led to the attack taking place. I knew that this pagination issue was a problem, but I never patched it because I didn&rsquo;t consider it to be a big deal.</p>

<p>This is also a great moment to reiterate something important: <strong>I always patch any outstanding bugs and exploits immediately</strong> - I value user trust and security too much to let anything terrible happen.</p>

<p><strong>There&rsquo;s never been any severe exploits on Makerlog - most have been access control problems (people editing other&rsquo;s tasks for example, haha). I can count them with one hand.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Your data is safe with me. I value your trust and privacy - let there be no doubt there.</strong></p>

<p>I apologize for this prioritizing problem, and I will make sure these things don&rsquo;t happen again.</p>

<h5 id="implementing-access-control-features">Implementing access control features</h5>

<p>As the user base and reach grows, so does the ratio of jerks to good people.</p>

<p>As stated earlier, Makerlog has always employed a trust-first model regarding API access. This excess user trust lends itself to abuse, and I will be switching to a &ldquo;precaution-first&rdquo; approach.</p>

<p>The dev community for Makerlog is amazing. New Makerlog integrations come out all the time, and it&rsquo;s my favorite thing to witness.</p>

<p>However, after this event, tighter controls will be implemented. I&rsquo;m not locking down the API completely, but throttling and other precautionary measures will be in place to prevent these attacks from happening in the future.</p>

<h2 id="thank-you-s">Thank you&rsquo;s!</h2>

<p>A huge shoutout to friends like <a href="https://twitter.com/jivings">James Ivings</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mubaris_nk">Mubaris NK</a> for their help mitigating the attack and figuring out the root cause. And of course, another big thank you to the community for being so supportive even in rough times.</p>

<h2 id="concluding">Concluding</h2>

<p>Last night I discovered there&rsquo;s jerks in the Internet.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad to say <em>we</em>, as a community, conquered.</p>

<p>This is a lesson to be learned from. Let&rsquo;s take a negative event and turn it into a positive learning experience - because this is how people and companies evolve.</p>
