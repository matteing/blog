      <description>The impact of social media on contemporary society is undeniable. Its rise over the last decade has given us an unprecedented power: the ability to communicate and spread our ideas far and wide in a matter of milliseconds. However, with such power in our hands, we must begin to question how our self expression has evolved alongside our technology. Newer generations are being raised with mass media at the touch of a finger, and older ones are constantly portraying themselves and sharing their personalities on social media.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from jerks in the Internet</title>

      <description>It was a dark, foggy night. In a cozy bed, I laid fast asleep after a long day of university lectures and late-night coding.
Suddenly, a long, annoying noise shook me off my sleep. Crawling to the other side of my bed, I reach my desk and clumsily grab my phone, in an attempt to shut that shit down.
It was a call. A call from a Makerlog member.</description>

      <title>A new, healthier chapter for Makerlog</title>

      <description>Today I am proud to announce the launch of Makerlog Wellness, a small - yet huge - update I&amp;rsquo;ve been silently working on for the past few weeks. Much thought went into the process of creating this update, and after careful consideration (and tons of pain rewriting the streak algorithm)&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s finally available for end users!
Before I continue with the features, we must take a moment to discuss why this update was necessary - in other words, how I discovered that the streak productivity model does not scale.</description>

      <description>As 2019 rapidly approaches, so begins my journey of introspection and quiet reflection about what Makerlog is and what direction to take it.
It&amp;rsquo;s incredible to look back and see the great growth of our community in such a short span of time - we&amp;rsquo;re already 1000+ friends - in just around six months! This is my first succesful product, and I plan to continue growing it throughout this new year and beyond.</description>

      <title>Completing the 24 Hour Startup Challenge</title>

      <description>This past weekend, hundreds of makers from around the community gathered together, taking part in the largest live-streamed startup event in the world. The premise of the challenge was simple: developers had 24 hours to ship a product. From design to development to launch.
And so they did. On November 18, over 88 apps were launched, taking over Product Hunt by storm.
I was one of these makers.</description>

      <title>Making in the Apocalypse: How I shipped a SaaS after Hurricane Maria</title>

      <description>This is naturally a difficult story to tell. It involves two very hard things for me, the passing of Hurricane María and the shutdown of a previous startup. But I’m wishing to tell my story, so others can learn and be inspired by it.
The calm September 16, 2017. Caguas, Puerto Rico.
You would’ve thought it was a normal day, until you looked at the TV monitors and noticed the panic that was going on.</description>
